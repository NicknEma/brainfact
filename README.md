# Brainfact
A brainfuck interpreter and brainfuck-to-C transpiler written in odin.

## What is brainfuck?
[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It looks like this:

```
+[-->-[>>+>-----<<]<--<---]>-.>>>+.>>..+++[.>]<<<<.+++.------.<<-.>>>>+.
```

This program prints `Hello, World!`.

## Why did I do this?
- To practice programming in odin.
- To build an interpreter/compiler without getting distracted by all the parsing theory and predefined structures that are easy to self-impose when thinking about a "regular" programming language.

## Build
#### Windows
- Make sure you have [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) installed on your device.
- Install the [Odin compiler](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) and [add its location to the `path`](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) environment variable.
- Either start a [64-bit developer command prompt](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022) or start a regular command prompt and run `vcvars64.bat`.
- Run `build.bat`.

## Use
- Run `bf.exe` (or simply `bf`) and pass to it a brainfuck source file to interpret. It will only run the first argument and ignore every other file. The _tests_ folder contains a bunch of brainfuck source files you can try to run.
- Run with the `-build` option to compile the argument (both to C and to an executable). You can optionally pass in another file name which will be used as the output name.
- Run `bf.exe -help` to see what you can do with it.

## Notes
Both the interpreter and the compiler use a "wrap-around" strategy when moving the data pointer out of bounds. The allocated space is of 30.000 bytes, and going off one end wraps you back to the other side.
